I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy at
the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/welcome). 
My work focuses on two (often intersecting) areas of philosophy --- the
history of Modern Philosophy (especially Kant) and the Philosophy of
Mind (especially perception).
