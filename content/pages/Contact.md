### PHIL 101 Students:

Email is the best way to reach me. I answer emails on weekdays, usually within 24 hrs. Please check the [syllabus](|filename|/pdfs/phil101/IntroSyllabus.pdf) before sending your question to see if it has already been covered. If you would like a response, please adhere to these basic email etiquette guidelines:

- Remember to include your full name and course/section.
- Use a professional email address, such as your UNL email account, to send email, instead of an anonymous internet account.
- Include an informative subject line that summarizes the content of your email (e.g. “Question about Assignment 3 for PHIL101″ instead of “Question”).
- Begin your email with an appropriate greeting (Dear/Hi/Hello [professor's name]).
- Keep the body of your email brief and to the point. If it’s longer than a paragraph, consider arranging a meeting during office hours to discuss your issue instead.
- Are you emailing with a question a classmate could answer (about material missed when absent, for example)? If so, ask that classmate before contacting your professor. It’s more efficient for everyone.
- Do not send personal/confidential information in an email; email is not secure.
- Keep your tone professional. Write in complete sentences and avoid text-speak. Note: If your email looks like this: “hi prof r we doing anything important 2day? kthxbai!” you are unlikely to receive a reply.
- End your email with a closing (Best/Thank you/Sincerely/etc.) and your first and last name.
- Remember to leave time to receive a response. Do not expect a reply over the weekend or at 3 am, for example.

Learning to communicate professionally is a critical skill that will help you in your future job searches and careers. Now is a good time to start practicing!
