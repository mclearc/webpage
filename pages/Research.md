Title: Research

Though I have quite general interests in the history of seventeenth and
eighteenth century European philosophy, my work mostly focuses on issues
pertaining to Immanuel Kant's philosophy of mind, perception, his theory of
human reason and rationality, and the broader metaphysical and epistemological
views with which these ideas are integrated. I'm also very interested in seeing
what, if any, connections may be made between Kant's positions and contemporary
research programs in philosophy of mind and metaphysics.
