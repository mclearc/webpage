I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy at
the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](http://www.unl.edu/philosophy/). 
My work focuses on two (often intersecting) areas of philosophy -- the
History of Modern Philosophy (especially Kant) and the Philosophy of
Mind.

Here is my complete [CV](|filename|/pdfs/McLearCV.pdf) (PDF).

I'm also organizing this year's [Chambers Conference (May 1-2, 2015)](http://colinmclear.net/chambers-conference). The theme concerns Kant's (and Kantian) views on introspection, self-consciousness, and self-knowledge.
